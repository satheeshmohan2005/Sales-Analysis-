Project Name : Sales Insights and Profit Maximization Analysis
________________________________________
Situation:
I worked on a data analysis project that involved sales data from a retail company. The company had a dataset with various columns, including Order ID, Order Date, Ship Mode, Segment, Category, and Profit information, among others. The main objective was to analyze this data to generate insights for strategic decisions like identifying high-profit products, understanding customer behavior, and measuring month-over-month sales growth.

Task:
My task was to perform several data operations:
1.	Calculate total profits based on per-unit profit and determine the top 10 highest profit-generating products.
2.	Filter and analyze orders from the 'Technology' category that were shipped using the 'Second Class' mode, ordered by the date.
3.	Calculate the average sales of orders by city and identify the city with the highest quantity of products ordered.
4.	Perform a quarter-based analysis, focusing on orders placed in the first quarter (January to March), and calculate the total cost for these orders.
5.	Create month-over-month growth comparisons for 2022 vs. 2023 sales and identify which sub-category had the highest growth by profit in 2023 compared to 2022.
6.	Visualize the findings to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

Action:
1.	Data Preprocessing: I cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python’s Pandas library, ensuring that the relevant columns (e.g., Product ID, Quantity, Selling Price, Unit Profit, Order Date, Ship Mode) were properly formatted and handled any missing or incorrect values.
2.	SQL Queries:
o	I connected to MySQL and used queries to perform aggregations and calculations directly in the database: 
	Calculated total profit and total selling price by multiplying Quantity with Unit Profit and Selling Price.
	Filtered orders from the 'Technology' category with 'Second Class' shipping mode and sorted by Order Date.
	Used SQL's GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses to calculate averages by city and identify the top 10 cities with the highest total quantity of products ordered.
	Ran complex aggregations, like calculating total cost for orders placed in the first quarter.
	Analyzed sales data for each month in 2022 and 2023, comparing them side by side to identify growth trends.
3.	Data Visualization:
o	I used Python’s Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize the results, highlighting growth trends and top-selling products.
o	I generated bar charts for the top 10 products by profit, pie charts for city-wise quantities, and line plots for month-over-month sales comparisons.

Result:
1.	Top 10 Products: Identified the highest profit-generating products, which helped the marketing team focus their efforts on promoting these items.
2.	City Insights: The analysis showed which cities had the highest product demand, allowing the logistics team to optimize delivery routes.
3.	First Quarter Analysis: The financial team got insights into the total cost of orders placed in the first quarter, which aided in better budget planning.
4.	Year-over-Year Growth Comparison: The comparison of 2022 and 2023 sales demonstrated significant growth in certain categories, particularly in the 'Technology' sector, where sales showed an increase of 12% year-over-year.
5.	Sub-category Growth: The 'Mobile Phones' sub-category showed the highest growth in 2023, which allowed the product team to focus on expanding this segment.
The insights derived from this analysis were crucial for various departments and contributed directly to informed decision-making processes within the company.
